				<h2>Charcoal Drawing</h2>
				<p>Artists' charcoal is a form of a dry art medium made of finely 
				   ground organic materials that are held together by a gum or 
				   wax binder or produced without the use of binders by eliminating
				   the oxygen inside the material during the production process.
				   These charcoals are often used by artists for their versatile
				   properties, such as the rough texture that leaves marks less
				   permanent than other Visual arts media.[2] Charcoal can produce 
				   lines that are very light or intensely black, while being hard
				   to remove completely. The dry medium can be applied to almost 
				   any surface from smooth to very coarse. </p>

				<h2>Pastel </h2>
				<p>A pastel is an art medium in the form of a stick,
				   consisting of powdered pigment and a binder.
				   The pigments used in pastels are similar to 
				   those used to produce some other colored visual 
				   arts media, such as oil paints; the binder is of
				   a neutral hue and low saturation. The color
				   effect of pastels is closer to the natural
				   dry pigments than that of any other process.
				   Pastels have been used by artists since the 
				   Renaissance, and gained considerable popularity in the 
				   18th century, when a number of notable artists made pastel
				   their primary medium.</p>

				<h2>Watercolour </h2>
				<p>It is the art of drawing, which is usually done on
				   paper using water-soluble pigments. 
				   Watercolors usually are mixed with water and 
				   the white ground (paper) underneath shines through
				   the painting. Watercolor paintings make for one
				   of the most versatile forms of paintings.</p>

				<h2>Oil Painting</h2>
				<p>Oil painting is the process of painting with pigments
				   with a medium of drying oil as the binder. Commonly
				   used drying oils include linseed oil, poppy seed oil,
				   walnut oil, and safflower oil. The choice of oil imparts
				   a range of properties to the oil paint, such as the 
				   amount of yellowing or drying time. The paint could be
				   thinned with Turpentine. Certain differences,
				   depending on the oil, are also visible in the sheen 
				   of the paints. An artist might use several different
				   oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments
				   and effects desired.</p>

				<h2>Acrylic painting</h2>
				<p>Acrylic paint is a fast-drying paint made of pigment suspended 
				   in acrylic polymer emulsion and plasticizers, silicon oils, 
				   defoamers, stabilizers, or metal soaps.[2] Acrylic paints 
				   are water-soluble, but become water-resistant when dry.
				   Depending on how much the paint is diluted with water,
				   or modified with acrylic gels, mediums, or pastes, the 
				   finished acrylic painting can resemble a watercolor, 
				   a gouache, or an oil painting, or have its own unique 
				   characteristics not attainable with other media</p>

				<h2>Ink painting</h2>
				<p>Ink painting originated in East Asia as the tradition
				   of using carbon-based black ink and calligraphic 
				   brush painting techniques, and has continued to
				   evolve as the basis for much contemporary works
				   in the region. Ink is as synonymous with painting
				   in the East as oil is with painting in the West. </p>
